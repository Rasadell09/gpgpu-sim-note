1. Environment is Ubuntu 15.04 and vm7.1.1(For Mac)

2. Need to run 64bits CUDA TOOLKIT 4.0 on vm:
(download CUDA TOOLKIT 4.0 and NVIDIA COMPUTING SDK 4.0 from NIVDIA official website (google: CUDA TOOLKIT 4.0 download))
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x *
sudo ./<these two files' name>

3. Need to install some basic tools:
apt-get install xutils-dev (For makedepend)
apt-get install zlib1g-dev
apt-get install bison
apt-get install flex

4. In Ubuntu 15.04, the gcc version is 4.9.2 which is not supported by the Nvidia Computing SDK, so we need to install gcc 4.4, and g++ must be the same version with gcc (also g++ 4.4):
apt-get install gcc-4.4
apt-get install g++-4.4
sudo rm /usr/bin/gcc
sudo rm /usr/bin/g++
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.4 /usr/bin/gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-4.4 /usr/bin/g++

5. We need to install some lib files:
apt-get install libGL-dev (For gpgpu-sim compile)
apt-get install libGLU-dev (For Nvidia Computing SDK compile)
apt-get install libXi-dev (For Nvidia Computing SDK compile)
apt-get install libXmu-dev (For Nvidia Computing SDK compile)
(libglut is for OpenGL, but cannot be found by name "libglut")
apt-cache search glut
(we find freeglut3-dev)
apt-get install freeglut3-dev (For Nvidia Computing SDK compile)
apt-get install libcuda1-304 (For Nvidia Computing SDK compile)
apt-get install nvidia-opencl-dev (For Nvidia Computing SDK compile)

6. Add following contents in .bashrc:
export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$CUDA_INSTALL_PATH/bin:$PATH
export NVIDIA_COMPUTE_SDK_LOCATION=~/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK
(save and close editor)
source ~/.bashrc

7. Compile GPGPU-SIM:
(cd into the gpgpu-sim directory)
source setup_environment
make

8. Compile Nvidia Computing SDK:
(cd into the Nvidia Computing SDK directory)
sudo make

9. Compile benchmarks:
apt-get install gfortran
make -f Makefile.ispass-2009
(AES,DG,DG/3rdParty still cannot compile, need to be comment)

10.Run benchmarks:
(copy the contents in GTX480/QuadroFX5600/QuadroFX5800 to benchmark directory)
./setup_config.sh GTX480 (Or other)
(cd into the benchmark directory)
sh README.GPGPU-Sim
